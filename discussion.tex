%TODO: Flesh out the discussion section.
%1. designing atoms automatically from programs to move beyond the atom design process we used for this paper.
%2. weaker consistency semantics
%3. approximate semantics
%4. clarifying that the current compiler doesn't guarantee completeness,
%5. building an optimizing compiler
%6. handling multiple transactions
