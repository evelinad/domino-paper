Come up with a one page architecture diagram / document
and a one paragraph compiler novelty story relative to prior work
(why the applications are new, why the techniques are simplified relative to prior work).

Explain it by analogy to the compiler world:

C --> LLVM --> x86 (the C world)
  --> Pipelined Virtual Switch --> PISA (our world)

Try and make the pipelined virtual switch analogous to LLVM.
* Also explain why LLVM doesn't cut it.
* Talk about our experiences compiling to LLVM and why a register machine
optimizes things willy nilly without respecting program semantics.
