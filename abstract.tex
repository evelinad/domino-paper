\subsection*{Abstract}

Data-plane algorithms encompass a wide variety of packet processing routines
including congestion control, network measurement, active queue management, and
load balancing. Such algorithms are implemented in hardware today, whose
inflexibility prohibits experiments with new designs. While programmable
switches have been proposed, they are difficult to
utilize due to the low-level nature of languages used to program them.

This paper presents \pktlanguage, a new language for expressing data-plane
algorithms on programmable switches. \pktlanguage is a high-level, imperative
language where developers express data-plane algorithms using packet functions
with transactional semantics. We have implemented a compiler that translates
\pktlanguage programs into pipelined implementations that run on an abstract
machine resembling emerging programmable switch architectures. We evaluate 
\pktlanguage by expressing several well-known data-plane algorithms and 
compiling them to be executed in abstract machine. \ac{Need to add 
something else here---I don't get how we will provide guidance on how 
switches should evolve}

in \pktlanguage to understand how capabilities of
the underlying abstract machine affect the implementability of different
algorithms---providing guidance on how such programmable switches should
evolve.
