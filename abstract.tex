\subsection*{Abstract}
Data-plane algorithms execute on every packet traversing a network switch; they
encompass many schemes for congestion control, network measurement,
active-queue management, and load balancing. Because these algorithms are
implemented in hardware today, they cannot be changed after being built. To
address this problem, recent work has proposed designs for programmable
line-rate switches.  However, the languages to program them closely resemble
the underlying hardware, rendering them inconvenient for this purpose.

This paper presents \pktlanguage, a C-like imperative language to express
data-plane algorithms. \pktlanguage introduces the notion of a {\em packet
transaction}, defined as a sequential code block that is atomic and isolated
from other such code blocks.  The \pktlanguage compiler compiles \pktlanguage
code to \absmachine, a family of abstract machines based on emerging
programmable switch chipsets. We evaluate \pktlanguage by first designing
concrete \absmachine machines that support a wide variety of data-plane
algorithms with modest die area overhead. We then show how \pktlanguage
simplifies programming them, relative to current languages for programmable
switches.
