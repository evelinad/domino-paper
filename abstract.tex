\subsection*{Abstract}
Data-plane algorithms are algorithms that execute on every packet and encompass
many packet-processing routines including congestion control, network
measurement, active queue management, and load balancing. Such algorithms are
implemented in hardware today, prohibiting reconfigurability in the field.
Programmable line-rate switches have been proposed. However, the languages used
to program them resemble the underlying hardware and aren't convenient to use.

This paper presents \pktlanguage, an imperative language for data-plane
algorithms. Programmers write data-plane algorithms in \pktlanguage using
packet transactions: sequential code blocks that run to completion on each
packet before processing the next one. The \pktlanguage compiler translates
\pktlanguage code to binaries that can be executed on \absmachine, a family of
abstract machines based on emerging programmable line-rate switches.  We
evaluate \pktlanguage by expressing several data-plane algorithms in
\pktlanguage and compiling them to different \absmachine machines.
