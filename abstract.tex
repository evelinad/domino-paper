\section*{Abstract}

Data-plane algorithms encompass a wide-variety of packet processing
routines. Such algorithms are usually
implemented in hardware, whose inflexibility prohibits
experiments with new designs. While programmable switches have been
proposed as an alternative, they are often difficult to program due 
to limited language support. In this paper, we propose \pktlanguage, 
a new language for expressing data-plane algorithms on programmable
switches. \pktlanguage is a high-level, imperative language where 
developers express data-plane algorithms using packet functions with
transactional semantics. In this paper we describe our prototype compiler that
translates \pktlanguage programs into P4 scripts that can be implemented
in programmable switches, and our experience in using \pktlanguage to 
implement several data-plane algorithms.
