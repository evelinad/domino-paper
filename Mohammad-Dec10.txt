1. Explain why sharing memory across stages is wrong for both correctness and wiring reasons.
   This will solidify the abstract machine model much further.

2. Be a little more natural about the progression of atoms so that it seems more natural.
   This way we get to present the model as a case study of how we could apply the compiler
   in the future.

3. Add the performance-programmability graph as a result.

4. Don't claim simplicity in the compiler as a technical contribution. Just make it a remark.

5. Do add the switch designer view point as a minor remark in evaluation.

6. Add LOC in P4 and in domino as comparison of expressiveness of the language.
