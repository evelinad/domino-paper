Alvin suggested that we just try out a dumb approach like what George
suggested:
--> Generate a recirculated packet, and then update state.
--> How do we make sure it isn't unnecessarily pessimal?
--> For instance (x, y) = (y + 5, x + 5) is actually doable in hardware, but
our algorithm wouldn't find it.
--> Alvin suggests shooting for the LPU here: basically the simplest algorithm
that fits into one stage:
: i.e. get _something_ working right away and then iterate.
: first cut, no reordering, just pessimally schedule instructions.
: Do packet-level partitioning, collect all state updates into one recirc
packet and then send it back towards the first stage of the pipeline.
