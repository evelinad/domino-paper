1. Relative to Intel's PLDI paper:
    --> Approximation angle
    --> New architectures, new tradeoffs, line-rate performance, approximations

2. Relative to Lavanya's paper:
    --> Higher level abstraction.
    --> Table mapping is orthogonal to our problem.
    --> We compile down to P4, Lavanya's paper takes over from there.
    --> Stateful processing.
    --> Congestion-control can be expressed in a higher level language.
