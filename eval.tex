%10. Alvin's feedback: Write about our experience writing these programs. Similar to Steven Chong's PLDI paper.
To evaluate \pktlanguage, we express several well-known data-plane algorithms
(Table~\ref{tab:algos}) using \pktlanguage and determine if they are
implementable on different \absmachine machines that provide different stateful
atoms (Table~\ref{tab:templates}).

\subsection{Experimental procedure}
As mentioned before, we consider only stateful atoms by assuming stateless
codelets map one-to-one to stateless atoms for all \absmachine machines. For
simplicity, the stateful atoms only permit updates to state variables and
forbid packet field updates mixed in with these state updates.  Assuming the
\absmachine machine provides an atom to read a state variable\footnote{The
inability to read a state variable renders it powerless!}, such packet updates
can be treated as stateless operations in subsequent pipeline stages.

%Anirudh->Alvin: Is it clear now that each machine provides exactly one atom.
We also assume every \absmachine machine provides exactly one stateful atom.
Table~\ref{tab:templates} gradually increases the capability of this single
atom.  We designed the atoms in Table~\ref{tab:templates}, and the \absmachine
machines providing them, to form a containment hierarchy
(Figure~\ref{fig:eval}): each atom can express all data-plane algorithms that
its predecessor can.

We now consider every atom/\absmachine machine from Table~\ref{tab:templates},
and every data-plane algorithm from Table~\ref{tab:algos} to determine if each
algorithm is \textit{implementable} on a particular \absmachine machine. We
say an algorithm is implementable on a \absmachine machine, if every stateful
codelet within the data-plane algorithm can be mapped (\S\ref{ss:code_gen}) to
the single stateful atom provided by the \absmachine machine.

\subsection{Interpreting these results}
Figure~\ref{fig:eval} tells a network programmer if a particular data-plane
algorithm can be implemented at line rate, assuming the \absmachine machine
provides a particular stateful atom. For an ASIC engineer designing
programmable switching chips, the same figure describes the algorithms that are
implementable on a particular \absmachine machine. For instance, a \absmachine
machine with the paired updates atom can implement eight algorithms shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:eval}, while a machine with a simpler read-add-write atom can
implement only two.

These results will change as programmable switches evolve and network
programmers push chip boundaries with new algorithms.  The larger takeaway is
that programming in \pktlanguage allows us to rigorously determine if a
particular high-level algorithm is implementable at line rate on a particular
\absmachine machine. Conversely, it tells us if a particular \absmachine
machine suffices to implement a large number of algorithms.
