\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:conclusion}
This paper presented \pktlanguage, a C-like imperative language that allows
programmers to write packet-processing code using packet transactions, which
are sequential code blocks that are atomic and isolated from other such code
blocks. The \pktlanguage compiler compiles packet transactions to hardware
configurations for \absmachine, which is a machine model based on programmable line-rate switch
architectures~\cite{flexpipe, xpliant, tofino}. Our results suggest that it is
possible to have both the convenience of a familiar programming model and the
performance of a line-rate switch, provided that the algorithm can indeed run
at line rate.  Packet-processing languages are still in their infancy; we hope
these results will prompt further work on programming abstractions for
high-performance packet-processing hardware.
