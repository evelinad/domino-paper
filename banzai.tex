\absmachine is a machine model for programmable line-rate switches that serves
as the compiler target for \pktlanguage.  \absmachine is inspired by recent
programmable switch architectures such as Barefoot Networks' Tofino~\cite{tofino},
Intel's FlexPipe~\cite{flexpipe}, and Cavium's XPliant Packet
Architecture~\cite{xpliant}. \absmachine abstracts these architectures and
extends them with stateful processing units to implement data-plane algorithms.
These processing units, called {\em atoms}, model the set of atomic operations
that a hardware target can execute at line rate.

\subsection{Background: Programmable switches}
Packets arriving at a switch~(top half of Figure~\ref{fig:switch}) are parsed
by a programmable parser that turns packets into header fields. These header
fields are first processed by an ingress pipeline consisting of match-action
tables arranged in stages. Processing a packet at a stage may modify its header
fields, through match-action rules, as well as some persistent state at that
stage, e.g., packet counters. After the ingress pipeline, the packet is
queued. Once the scheduler dequeues the packet, it is processed by a
similar egress pipeline before it is transmitted.

To reduce chip area, there is only one ingress and one egress pipeline.  This
single pipeline is shared across all switch ports and handles aggregate traffic
belonging to all ports, at all packet sizes.  For instance, a 64-port switch
with a line rate of 10 Gbit/s per port and a minimum packet size of 64 bytes
needs to process around a billion packets per second, after accounting for
minimum inter-packet gaps~\cite{rmt}.  Equivalently, the pipeline runs at 1
GHz, and pipeline stages process a packet every clock cycle (1 ns).  We assume
one packet per clock cycle throughout the paper, and for concreteness, a
1 GHz clock frequency.

Having to process a packet every clock cycle in each stage greatly constrains
the operations that can be performed on each packet. In particular, any packet
operation that modifies state visible to the next packet {\em must} finish
execution in a single clock cycle (see \S\ref{ss:atoms} for details). Because
of this restriction, programmable switching chips provide a small set of
processing units or primitives for manipulating packets and state in a stage,
unlike software routers. These processing units determine the algorithms that
run on the switch at line rate.
%TODO: must finish within a clock cycle is a bit too strong, I think.

The challenge for us is to develop primitives that allow a broad range of
data-plane algorithms to be implemented, and to build a compiler to map a
user-friendly description of an algorithm to the primitives provided by a
switch.

\subsection{The \absmachine machine model}

\absmachine (the bottom half of Figure~\ref{fig:switch}) models
the ingress or egress switch pipeline.  It models the
computation within a match-action table in a stage (i.e., the action half of
the match-action table), but not how packets are matched (e.g., direct or
ternary). We discuss how to embed \absmachine in a standard match-action
pipeline in \S\ref{ss:guards}.  \absmachine also does not model packet parsing and assumes
that packets arriving to \absmachine are already parsed.

 Concretely, \absmachine is a feed-forward pipeline\footnote{It is hard to
physically route backward-flowing wires that would be required for feedback.}
consisting of a number of stages executing synchronously on every clock cycle.
Each stage processes one packet every clock cycle and hands it off to the next.
Unlike a CPU pipeline, which occasionally suffers from pipeline stalls,
\absmachine's pipeline is deterministic, never stalls, and always sustains line
rate. However, relative to a CPU pipeline, \absmachine is restricted in the
operations it supports (\S\ref{s:atomConstraints}).

\subsection{Atoms: \absmachine's processing units}
\label{ss:atoms}
 An {\em atom} is an atomic unit of packet processing supported natively by a
\absmachine machine, and the atoms within a \absmachine machine form its
instruction set. Each pipeline stage in \absmachine contains a vector of atoms.
Atoms in the vector modify mutually exclusive sections of the same packet
header in parallel in every clock cycle, and process a new packet header every
clock cycle.

In addition to packet headers, atoms may modify persistent state on the switch
to implement stateful data-plane algorithms. To support such algorithms at
line-rate, the atoms for a \absmachine machine need to be substantially richer
(Table~\ref{tab:templates}) than the simple RISC-like stateless instruction
sets for programmable switches today~\cite{rmt}. We explain why below.

Suppose we need to atomically increment a switch counter to count packets. One
approach is hardware support for three simple single-cycle operations:
\textit{read} the counter from memory in the first clock cycle, \textit{add}
one in the next, and \textit{write} it to memory in the third.  This approach,
however, does not provide atomicity. To see why, suppose packet $A$ increments
the counter from 0 to 1 by executing its read, add, and write at clock cycles
1, 2, and 3 respectively.  If packet $B$ issues its read at time 2, it will
increment the counter again from 0 to 1, when it should be incremented to 2.

Locks over the shared counter are a potential solution.  However, locking
causes packet $B$ to wait during packet $A$'s increment, and the switch no
longer sustains the line rate of one packet every clock cycle. CPUs employ
microarchitectural techniques such as operand forwarding to address this
problem, but CPUs still suffer the occasional pipeline stall, which prevents
line-rate performance from being achieved.

\absmachine provides an atomic increment operation at line rate with an {\em
atom} to read a counter, increment it, and write it back in a single stage within
one clock cycle. It uses the same approach of reading, modifying, and writing
back to implement other stateful atomic operations at line rate.

Unlike stateful atomic operations, stateless atomic operations are easier to
support with simple packet-field arithmetic.  Consider, for
instance, the operation {\tt pkt.f1 = pkt.f2 + pkt.f3 - pkt.f4}.  This
operation does not modify any persistent switch state and only accesses packet
fields. It can be implemented atomically by using two atoms: one atom to add
fields f2 and f3 in one pipeline stage, and another to subtract f4 from the
result in the next. An instruction set designer can provide {\em simple}
stateless instructions on pairs of packet fields alone, which can then be
composed into larger stateless operations, without designing atoms specifically
for each stateless operation.

\new{
\paragraph{Representing atoms}
An atom is represented by a body of sequential code that captures the atom's
behavior. It may also contain internal state local to the atom. An atom
completes execution of this entire body of code, modifying a packet and any
internal state before processing the next packet. The designer of a
programmable switch would develop these atoms, and expose them to a switch
compiler as the programmable switch's instruction set, e.g.,
Table~\ref{tab:templates}.
}
Using this representation, a switch counter that wraps around at a
value of 100 can be written as the atom:\footnote{We use {\tt p.x} to
  represent field {\tt x} within a packet {\tt p} and {\tt x} to
  represent a state variable {\tt x} that persists across packets.}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=customc, numbers=none, frame=none]
if (counter < 99)
  counter++;
else
  counter = 0;
\end{lstlisting}

Similarly, a stateless operation like setting a packet field to a constant
value can be written as the atom:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=customc, numbers=none, frame=none]
  p.field = value;
\end{lstlisting}

%TODO: Flip flopping between constraints and limits
\subsection{Constraints for line-rate operation}
\label{s:atomConstraints}

\new{
\textbf{Memory limits: } State in \absmachine is local to each atom.  It can
neither be shared by atoms within a stage, nor atoms across stages. This is
because building multi-ported memories accessible to multiple atoms is
technically challenging and consumes additional chip area. However, state can
be read into a packet header in one stage for subsequent use by a downstream
stage\footnote{Figure~\ref{fig:flowlet_pipeline} shows an example. {\tt
last\_time} is read into {\tt pkt.last\_time} in stage 2, for subsequent use by stage 3.}.  But, the \absmachine pipeline is
feed-forward, so state can only be carried forward, not backward.
}

\textbf{Computational limits:} Atoms need to execute atomically from one packet
to the next, so any state internal to the atom must be updated
before the next packet arrives.  Because packets may be separated by as little
as one clock cycle, we mandate that atom bodies finish execution within one
clock cycle, and constrain atom bodies to do so.

We constrain atom bodies by defining {\it atom templates}
(\S\ref{ss:code_gen}).  An atom template is a program with configurable
parameters that terminates within a clock cycle and specifies the atom's
behavior.  An example is an ALU with a restricted set of primitive operations
(Figure~\ref{fig:alu_diag}).

% Atom templates allow us to create
%and experiment with \absmachine machines with different atoms.

%As programmable
%switches evolve, we expect that atoms will evolve as well, but constrained by
%the clock-cycle requirement.

  variable {\tt x} based on two configurable parameters, {\tt constant} and {\tt choice}.}

\end{figure}

\textbf{Resource limits:} We also limit the number of atoms in each stage
(\textit{pipeline width}) and the number of stages in the pipeline
(\textit{pipeline depth}). This is similar to limits on the number of stages,
tables per stage, and memory per stage in programmable switch
architectures~\cite{lavanya_compiler}.

\subsection{What can \absmachine not do?}
\label{ss:limitations}

\absmachine is a good fit for data-plane algorithms that modify a small set of
packet headers and carry out small amounts of computation per packet.
Data-plane algorithms like deep packet inspection and WAN optimization require
a switch to parse and process the packet payload as well---effectively parsing
a large ``header'' consisting of each byte in the payload. This is challenging
at line rates of 1 GHz, and such algorithms are best left to CPUs~\cite{e2}.
Some algorithms require complex computations, but not on every packet, e.g., a
measurement algorithm that periodically scans a large table to perform garbage
collection.  \absmachine's atoms model small operations that occur on every
packet, and are unsuitable for such operations that span many clock cycles.
