2. (Maybe) move to a slightly more complicated partitioning algorithm:
analyze disjoint path conditions to see if more reordering is permissive.

Basically span the spectrum from crappy implementations all the way to
optimized implementations.

But as far as HotNets goes, no one even knows about this problem. So you might
as well introduce it well, try and present the LPU (like Alvin said) and
iterate from there, whether it be more sophisticated scheduling, more
sophisticated approximations , shared memory and so on.

Might have to change the pitch to data plane algorithms and talk about meters
and EWMA generators as our use cases because these are easiest to grok to begin
with. We can even sell them with open-loop traffic unlike AQM schemes.

===========================================================

Like Mihai said:
1. Maybe avoid nested conditionals and convert them into and statements.
2. Maybe avoid saying x = p ? y : x and use the GNU conditional extension instead,
might avoid some spurious dependencies.

============

Need to flatten out expressions and maybe also do the if conversion without surgery,
like Mihai suggested.
