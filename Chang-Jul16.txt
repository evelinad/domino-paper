Yesterday 3:18 pm draft:

Maybe try and see if we can replace RMT architecture with something else
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chang introduction:
---------------------------
In the introduction be even more explicit to talk about what the problem with
P4.  But there are other kinds of important data plane algorithms that are not
even well aligned with match-action at all.

It's not clear how to force some of the ideas into the match-action
abstraction.

Another important high-level bit:
--------------------------------
Each section is totally independent. There is no flow between the sections at
all.  There doesn't seem to be coherence across sections here.

The RMT architecture: Draw the concept that the pipeline has multiple physical
stages. Also that stateful memory is contained within each stage.

Packet fields: header fields + metadata.
Mention that there are two types of
variable that we are looking at: packet-local variables and persistent
variables (Define them upfront in section 2, visualize them in figure, and use
them consistently throughout the rest of the paper).

Section #4:
-------------------------------
It would be good to describe the design as through it is coming from a set of
principles. For each one of these tasks, specify exactly what we are trying to
achieve and why it is important.

Give some intuition into why this structuring of the compiler is the right way
to structure things. Chang said it didn't make sense why this was a natural 
way of structuring the compiler.

For sections 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6, it would be even clearer if we define the
constraints very well in the architecture section and then show how we address
them in Sections 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6 Relate the algorithms back to the hardware
constraints using well defined language.

Something like "Because of these constraints", the solutions to 4.4, 4.5, and
4.6 are the right answers to the constraints. It seems like when we are
explaining 4.4/5/6, we are creating the problem and solving it there. Better
way would be to move the problems to earlier sections. Investing in section 2
will pay off when describing solutions in later sections.

Section 4.7: Chang doesn't get the motivation of the batches either. It's
really sampling, not batching. Explaining this notion of recirculation latency,
recirculation latency, pass through, and batching is useful here.

Figure 1:
----------------------
The reason we don't know from Section 2 + Figure 1 that there are multiple
physical stages and $N$ numbers of packets in flight. Each one is in a separate
stage and they are moving stage by stage.

We forgot to explain the basics in this paper. No one can understand it very
clearly right now.
