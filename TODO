1. Just say 10 atoms per stage and 32 stages and nothing more. This should keep the description simpler, like Mihai suggested.
(It also gets rid of all the verbage around stateful memories).
2. Rename Pairs to Pair.
3. Name atoms more evocatively.
4. Maybe switch to flowlet switching as the example??
