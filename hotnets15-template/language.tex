\section{A Language for data-plane algorithms}
\label{s:language}

Now that we have talked about using transactions, we fill in the details of how we restrict transactions to be useful enough to express line-rate processing. I think that's really the core contribution: using transactions, but making the language within the transaction simple enough to be practical on line-rate switches.

here's the language:

Language: No loops, no break, no continue, no switch, goto
Chang's description: O(1) code.
What we can't do: scans, loops, etc.

Show how some examples from the preceding section can be expressed in our
language.

Maybe write out the BNF for the language.
