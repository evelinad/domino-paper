\section{Future work}
1. Arrays and other aggregates.
2. Table layout: compiling to P4 and then go down. Make it the P4 compiler's problem.
TCP traffic and end-to-end evaluation of approximation quality like video quality in approximate computing.
So far our approach to evaluating approximations is empirical, not analytical. Analysis would be awesome.
