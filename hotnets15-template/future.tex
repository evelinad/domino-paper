\section{Future work}
\label{s:future}
1. Arrays and other aggregates.
2. Table layout: compiling to P4 and then go down. Make it the P4 compiler's problem.
TCP traffic and end-to-end evaluation of approximation quality like video quality in approximate computing.
So far our approach to evaluating approximations is empirical, not analytical. Analysis would be awesome.
3. Scheduling, by definition, requires looking at multiple packets together to
make a decision on what packet to schedule next, while data-plane algorithms
operate independenly on each packe
