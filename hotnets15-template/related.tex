Talk about what data-plane algorithms we can and don't focus on here: prefix
lookup, DPI, etc.
  
 We focus on data-plane algorithms that aren't widely available on all switches
today because of the considerable engineering effort required for hardware
implementations and the rapidly changing nature of these algorithms. For
instance, load-balancing algorithms such as CONGA~\cite{conga} are available
only on a specific line of CISCO switches.  Active queue-management algorithms
such as CoDel~\cite{codel} need to be extensively modified~\cite{pie} to suit
the architecture of a hardware switch.  Explicit congestion-control algorithms
such as RCP~\cite{rcp} and XCP~\cite{xcp}, and measurement algorithms such as
OpenSketch~\cite{opensketch} have been evaluated only in FPGA-based platforms.
The ever-growing list of new algorithms~\cite{pdq, d3, detail} makes it
challenging to commit to a hardware implementation of any of them.

Talk about how NPUs don't cut it even though they are hyper expressive.

Our work can be viewed as a recommendation to extend P4 with transactional
actions, and can benefit from the rest of P4's abstractions: arbitrary match
entries, typed header fields, control flow across tables, and programmable
packet parsing.

NPUs: Tradeoffs are different here. Each stage can do very very little on a
switch relative to an NPU. NPUs are Turing-complete; here, on a switch,
programs either fit or don't. If they don't fit, you need to approximate.

P4 compiler (Lavanya's work): Complementary backend.

CMU work on pipelining datapaths: Verilog and circuits.

P4 itself: Too low level. NetASM: Once P4 needs an IR, NetASM might be a good
choice.

Click: P4 paper wrote it off. We think its worth revisiting here.

Fastpass or Flexplane: Say that you love the abstraction they propose, but
would love to do it at higher line rates.

Click, Maple, Flexplane: Proposed transactions first. We are inspired by them.
