\section{Evaluation}
\label{s:evaluation}
% Run some experiments with a stateless program.
% 1. We can compile more than one program (CRC16 checker).
% 2. We can compile more than one interesting program.
% 3. That the compilations actually works.
% 4. (Approximations can be omitted for now, punt to future work). 
Tick-based pipeline simulator, open-loop Poisson traffic

\subsection{The correct mapping}
Show one correct mapping, just demonstrates correctness.

\subsection{Approximating algorithms}
Present EWMA example. Show how
1. Without MAC or tupled instructions, you need to use recirculation, which leverages the approximate nature of EWMA.
2. With MAC instructions, you can do EWMA exactly.
