\label{s:evaluation}
Tick-based ppeline simulator, open-loop Poisson traffic

\subsection{The correct mapping}
Show one correct mapping, just demonstrates correctness.

\subsection{Approximating algorithms}
Present EWMA example. Show how
1. Without MAC or tupled instructions, you need to use recirculation, which leverages the approximate nature of EWMA.
2. With MAC instructions, you can do EWMA exactly.
