-----------------------------
Conclude with a summary at section 2.5 on why building a compiler is difficult:
It's because we need to map a high-level language into a lower-level language / hardware.

=================

Intro to 4 will depend on the merged 2 + 3.
------------------------------------------
Alvin will add stuff about the grammar.
Paragraph about P4 at the end of 4, should probably go into the intro, so that
it's clear why P4 doesn't work.

Explain the technical challenge in going from domino to P4 in the beginning of
5 or end of 4.

4: Explain motivation for language, what the language is, and introduce the running example.
Here's a running example in our language. Imagine writing P4 code for this. It's so much better.

Change the story in Section 5 to say we are compiling to P4:

Talk about how domino to P4 looks nice but we need to solve it.
Here are the challenges:
1. Partitioning: Figuring out what can be executed in parallel.
2. Stateful business.
3. Handling control flow.
4. A number of preprocessing steps to make the job of partitioner easier.
