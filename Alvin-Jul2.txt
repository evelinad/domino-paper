1. Can we do everything manually?
2. Partitioning result will be exactly the same as the manually done.
3. Alvin says that the manual approach is more than sufficient for HotNets.

Alvin's contributions:
--------------------
1. Proposing the use of transactions as a way to structure congestion-control
algorithms.  Use software to express congestion-control algorithms instead of
implementing this in hardware. We are teaching people a way to structure code:
Contribution one.

2. We have a system that takes this code and compiles it into hardware using
whatever metrics the people care about. And we are proposing that we use a
compiler to compile it to a set of programmable hardware blocks.

3. We evaluate these approximations (vision as far as HotNets is concerned,
concrete when NSDI comes up).

Alvin's questions: which subset of these go into the HotNets contributions?

Next Wednesday start writing.
