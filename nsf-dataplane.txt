domino:
  Compiling from a transactional specification to a pipeline.
  Narrower domain than usual, which is why we can even get performance.
  RELATED WORK: Contrast with other compiler work.
  domino presents design where it's either doable or not.
  With an NPU there's always a temptation to degrade functionality.
  Refuse to run the program: make that a virtue.
  Say that it's a distinction from the NPU style: NPUs had no guarantee on performance.
  Step back one level more: Emphasise the most interesting novel parts of the work.
  Emphasize novelty within the introduction.
  Have a clear focus on the new contributions.

  Hari says we need a before and after figure for what domino contributes over P4/RMT.
