Hari's questions:
1. Flexible resouce management algorithms

Problem statement:
-->Like to be able to come up with a framework by which network operators can easily
express algorithms for a software switch.
-->Vendors that write algorithms for the router itself. After the vendor sells the
router, they want to express an algorithm.
-->Similar to FlexPlane's motivation.

Three contributions:
----
I can use existing hardware without modifying it.
1. Define a specific hardware substrate. Define the instruction set for the hardware. NOT SO MUCH
2. Way to express algorithms in software. DONE
3. The Compiler itself. DONE
4. Consistency guarantees and approximations DONE

I don't think the motivation is hard and is similar to FlexPlane:
-----------------------------

Main thing to convince readers about:
-------------------
1. That it's doable.
2. It's a sensible proposal.
3. The risk is really about whether we can provide this flexibility.
