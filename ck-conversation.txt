Constraints on the number of parallel actions:
1. Number of independent VLIW operations.
2. Number of distinct action primitives
   that can be encoded.
3. Number of action data bits.

So, if we are down to (say) 5 instructions every clock, we should be fine.
Question is, why is this fine?

One way to attack this is to say that to really solve the table placement
problem, we need to know all the other features that are enabled or disabled on
that switch, which is beyond the scope of our paper.

In the absence of such detailed knowledge, the least we can do is to minimize
the number of physical stages without worrying about other features that
restrict the degree of parallelism.
